### Procedure
    <h1>UV Absorbance Spectroscopy</h1>
    <p>For measuring the concentration of a protein with an unknown extinction coefficient using a protein standard, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add blank buffer to a clean quartz cuvette and use it to zero the spectrophotometer.</li>
        <li>Use a fresh, identical cuvette or replace the buffer with the sample. Measure the absorbance at 280 nm. If the signal is outside the linear range of the instrument (typically an absorbance greater than 2.0), dilute the protein in buffer and remeasure.</li>
        <li>After measuring the sample, remeasure the blank buffer to correct for any instrument drift.</li>
        <li>Determine the unknown concentrations from the linear standard response.</li>
        <li>Read the absorbance of the test protein versus a suitable control at 280 nm.</li>
        <li>A very rough approximation for the proteins is 1 absorbance unit is equal to 1 mg/mL.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Protein A280 (for 1 mg/mL): IgG 1.35; IgM 1.2; BSA 0.7</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Protein Solutions Contaminated with Nucleic Acids</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Read the absorbance versus a suitable control at 280 and 260 nm, or 280 and 205 nm.</li>
        <li>Calculate the approximate concentration using the equation:<br>
            <strong>Protein concentration (in mg/mL) = (1.55 × A280) − (0.76 × A260)</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Light Scattering from Turbid Protein Solutions</h2>
    <p>Light scattering from turbid protein samples imposes an error in measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Suspended particles can reduce the light that reaches the detector, causing erroneous increases in absorbance.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Filter and centrifuge the samples to ensure accurate measurements.</p>

    <h1>Dye-based Protein Assays</h1>
    <h2>Reagent Requirement</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve 100 mg of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in 50 ml of 95% ethanol.</li>
        <li>Add 100 ml of 85% phosphoric acid while stirring continuously.</li>
        <li>Once the dye has dissolved, dilute the solution to 1 liter with water.</li>
        <li>The reagent is stable for up to a month at room temperature. For long-term storage, keep it at 4°C. If precipitation occurs, filter the solution before use.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare standards in the range of 100–1500 µg/ml using a Bradford-compatible buffer.</li>
        <li>Add the standard and unknown samples to disposable cuvettes.</li>
        <li>Allow the Bradford reagent to warm to room temperature. Add 1 ml of the dye solution to 25 µl of the protein sample, mix, and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Measure the absorbance at 450 nm and 595 nm.</li>
        <li>Plot either the 595 nm data or the ratio of 595 nm/450 nm. Fit the standard response curve to calculate unknown protein concentrations.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="caution">
        <p><strong>Caution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watch the sample-to-dye ratio; if too high, the pH of the reaction mixture could increase, leading to higher background responses.</li>
            <li>Allow the Bradford reagent to warm to room temperature before use.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="precaution">
        <p><strong>Precautions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>This assay is relatively accurate for most proteins, except for small basic polypeptides such as ribonuclease or lysozyme.</li>
            <li>Results with commercial Bradford reagent from Bio-Rad give consistent results.</li>
            <li>Bradford assay is sensitive to glycosylated proteins.</li>
            <li>Non-solubilized proteins may require the addition of 1 M NaOH at 5–10% (v/v) to aid solubilization.</li>
        </ul>
