## Aim of the experiment
The main aim of this lab is to help the students understand the importance of accurate protein estimation and the concepts of the protocols/methods of quantitative protein estimation. Accurate protein estimation is a mandatory step before advanced techniques of analysis.   Before starting the protein estimation, the selection of the assay method is of prime importance. 

This lab aims to train students to:
1.	Select an appropriate protein assay method based on the physicochemical properties of the protein sample, required sensitivity, and compatibility with reagents.
2.	Perform and compare different standard protein estimation assays, including UV absorbance, Lowry, Bradford, and Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) methods.
3.	Interpret and analyze quantitative data obtained from standard curves and absorbance readings to determine unknown protein concentrations.
4.	Evaluate the advantages, limitations, and interferences of each method in relation to sample type and experimental conditions.
5.	Develop good laboratory practices (GLP) in handling proteins, reagents, and spectrophotometric equipment for reliable and reproducible results.
